Hi Lewis,  
Big news! Do you remember all those problems I was having with Eve? Well, the next day, Eve and I planned to go to that free music festival in West Park, and she suggested *1 bringing* (bring) her friend Abigail. She promised *2 to meet* (meet) me at 6.30 p.m., but only Abigail came. We listened to a few bands, and I offered *3 to buy* (buy) her an ice cream. At first, she didn’t explain why *4 Eve wasn’t* (Eve/not be there). But in the end, I persuaded *5 her to tell* (her/tell) me. She said Eve was bowling with Josh from Year 12! I was really angry, but she reminded me that *6 Eve and Josh are* (Eve and Josh/be) good friends, and denied *7 they were dating* (they/dating). She advised me *8 to stay* (stay) cool and let Eve explain. But she also admitted *9 feeling* (feel) embarrassed about the situation. So I agreed *10 to keep* (keep) quiet. But yesterday, I decided that I’d had enough, and so I invited *11 Abigail to go* (Abigail/go) to a party with me on Saturday, but I’m afraid she’ll refuse *12 to come* (come). Did I do the right thing?
